## 🏗️ &nbsp; Why I Chose This Project

I want to provide evidence of my skills and abilities in new technologies that I've learned in my own time. 

I focus on the most common requirements posted on job vacancies as well as the workflow used by digital agencies such as a good knowledge of
Git, GitHub and agile methodologies. 

There is still a lot more I wish to achieve such as learning module bundlers like WebPack and back end technologies.

## Potential Future Features

When I have the time, I need to add a sticky navigation 🩹
